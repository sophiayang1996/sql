select company_id, employee_id, employee_name, 
if(salary<1000, salary, if(salary <= 10000, salary*76%, salary*51%)) salary
from salaries

don't understand

answer:
select s.company_id, employee_id, employee_name, round(salary*sr) salary
from salaries s
join (
    select company_id,
    case when max(salary) < 1000 then 1 
         when max(salary)<=10000 then 0.76
    else 0.51 end sr
    from salaries
    group by company_id) f1
on s.company_id = f1.company_id


note:
case when then when then else end
is like if then elif then else

the first conditon is satisfied the second won't run, so there is no need to exclud the first condition in the second one

like 
case when a<10 then b when a<20 then c else d

it will be faster than redundant conditions
